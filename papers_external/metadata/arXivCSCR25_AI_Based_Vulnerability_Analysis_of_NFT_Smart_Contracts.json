  "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the NFT market, the security of smart contracts has\nbecome crucial. However, existing AI-based detection models for NFT contract\nvulnerabilities remain limited due to their complexity, while traditional\nmanual methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes an AI-driven\napproach to detect vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts.\n  We collected 16,527 public smart contract codes, classifying them into five\nvulnerability categories: Risky Mutable Proxy, ERC-721 Reentrancy, Unlimited\nMinting, Missing Requirements, and Public Burn. Python-processed data was\nstructured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini\ncoefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction.\nA random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random\ndata/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter\ntuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating\nparameter impacts on vulnerability detection.\n  Results show the random forest model excels in detecting all five\nvulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing\nauthorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy\ndetection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble\napproach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance\nimprovements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient\ntechnical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for\nscaling AI applications.",
