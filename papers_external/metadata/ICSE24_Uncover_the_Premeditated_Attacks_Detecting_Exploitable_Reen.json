  "abstract": "Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions\nof dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability\ndetection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts\nwith reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected\nreentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools\nless effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting\nreentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker\ncontracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts\nautomatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively\ndetects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant\ncall flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of\nreentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or\nuser-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rule-based tools.\nWe implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques\nbased on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker\ncontracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889\nEthereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target\n159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at\napproximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim\ncontracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.",
