  "abstract": "Ethereum Smart contracts use blockchain to transfer values among peers on\nnetworks without central agency. These programs are deployed on decentralized\napplications running on top of the blockchain consensus protocol to enable\npeople to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. The\nsecurity vulnerabilities within those smart contracts are a potential threat to\nthe applications and have caused huge financial losses to their users. In this\npaper, we present a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to\ndetect Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. This framework\ngenerates an attacker contract based on the ABI specifications of smart\ncontracts under test and analyzes the contract interaction to precisely report\nReentrancy vulnerability. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our proposed\nframework on 5 modified smart contracts from Etherscan and our framework was\nable to detect the Reentrancy vulnerability in all our modified contracts. Our\nframework analyzes smart contracts statically to identify potentially\nvulnerable functions and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm\nReentrancy vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and reduced\nfalse positives.",
