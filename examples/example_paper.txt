Title: Automated Detection of Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts

Abstract: Smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms like Ethereum are susceptible to various security vulnerabilities, with reentrancy attacks being one of the most devastating. The DAO attack in 2016 resulted in a loss of $60 million due to a reentrancy vulnerability. This paper presents a novel static analysis approach that combines symbolic execution and taint analysis to automatically detect reentrancy vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. Our tool analyzes contract bytecode and identifies vulnerable patterns without requiring source code access. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 10,000 real-world smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and demonstrate that it achieves 95% precision and 92% recall in detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities, outperforming existing state-of-the-art tools. The results show that automated analysis can significantly improve the security of smart contract development.
